Easy-meets provides a user-friendly interface for exploring and searching for places using the Google Places API and interact with their friends. It features a map view where users can drag a marker to select a location and search for places within a specified radius. The search results are displayed as swipeable cards. Users can also search for places by entering a text query. The application includes a settings page where users can adjust the type of places to search for. The application uses React hooks for state management and the async/await syntax for handling asynchronous operations. It also includes error handling to catch and log any errors that occur during the API calls.
